          When several packages are created from a single repo, such as for Toga, a separate artifact
          will be created for each package, e.g. Packages-toga-core, Packages-toga-android, etc.
          Therefore, the base name for these artifacts is Packages-toga. This output allows the caller
          to retrieve all of these related artifacts with one call to actions/download-artifact.
