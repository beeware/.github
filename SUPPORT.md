# Support policy

The BeeWare Project is in the early stages of development. As such, it is still
in rapid development. While we endeavour to minimize backwards compatibility
problems, we make no guarantees at this time.

As each project in the BeeWare suite of tools and libraries reach a point of
stability, we will increment it's version number to 1.0. At that point, we will
introduce a formal backwards compatibility and support policy.

## Python Version support.

We support Python 3.5 and above. Support for pre-release versions of Python is
not guaranteed.
