# Code of Conduct

*This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version
1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct.html)*

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
* Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
  reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
  that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
  permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem
  inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.


## Making a CoC complaint

*This reporting guide draws heavily from the [Django Software Foundation Code
of Conduct Reporting Guide](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/).*

If you believe someone is violating the BeeWare Project Code of Conduct we ask
that you report it to the BeeWare Project by emailing one or more of the
senior project maintainers:

* Russell Keith-Magee (@freakboy3742; [russell@beeware.org](mailto:russell@beeware.org))
* Katie McLaughlin (@glasnt; [katie@beeware.org](mailto:katie@beeware.org))
* Philip James (@phildini [philip@beeware.org](mailto:philip@beeware.org))

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a
public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of
all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals
instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.

In your report please include:

* **Your contact info** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.** If
  there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
  a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* If you believe any member of the core team has a conflict of interest in
  adjudicating the incident.
* What, if any, corrective response you believe would be appropriate.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

Core team members are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter and details of an incident.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email acknowledging receipt of your complaint. We promise
to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than
that).

The core team will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Who the bad actor was.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety.
* If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
  safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone
  involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe
  that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.
* If a member of the core team is one of the named parties, they will not be
  included in any discussions, and will not be provided with any confidential
  details from the reporter.

If anyone on the core team believes they have a conflict of interest in
adjudicating on a reported issue, they will inform the other core team members,
and recuse themselves from any discussion about the issue. Following this
declaration, they will not be provided with any confidential details from the
reporter.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
  list or IRC).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all BeeWare spaces (GitHub
  repositories, Gitter rooms, etc.)
* A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, depending on the specifics of the incident and the potential for
ongoing harm, the core team may choose to make a public report of the incident
on The Buzz, the BeeWare blog.
